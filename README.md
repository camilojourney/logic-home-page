# Logic Vibe 🏭✨

**The Blueprint for the Era of Autonomous Industrial Intelligence.**

Logic Vibe is an AI-native copilot for industrial automation. It bridges the gap between modern software development and industrial control systems (ICS), allowing engineers to generate, simulate, and verify PLC logic in a high-fidelity web environment before deployment.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Evaluation First**: Validate logic flow and safety in a browser-based simulation ("Vibe Check").
*   **Legacy Resurrection**: Modernize legacy manufacturing code (Ladder Logic, STL) into compliant, documented structures.
*   **Polyglot Core**: Support for IEC 61131-3 (LD, ST) alongside modern languages like Python, Rust, and Go.
*   **Interactive Documentation**: Comprehensive guide to system architecture and safety protocols.
*   **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4, and Three.js for a premium, "Precision Glass" aesthetic.
